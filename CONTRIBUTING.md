---

## 📐 Coding Standards

### JavaScript/Node.js Style

- Use **ES6+ syntax** (async/await, arrow functions, destructuring)
- Use **2 spaces** for indentation
- Use **single quotes** for strings
- Add **semicolons** at the end of statements
- Use **camelCase** for variables and functions
- Use **PascalCase** for classes and React components
- Use **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** for constants

### Code Organization

**Backend Structure:**
```
backend/src/
├── routes/          # Express route definitions only
├── controllers/     # Request/response handling, no business logic
├── services/        # Business logic and external API calls
├── models/          # Mongoose schemas and database models
├── middleware/      # Express middleware (auth, validation, etc.)
├── utils/           # Helper functions and utilities
└── config/          # Configuration files
```

**Frontend Structure:**
```
frontend/src/
├── pages/           # Next.js pages (routing)
├── components/      # Reusable React components
├── services/        # API client and external services
└── styles/          # CSS and styling
```

### Best Practices

- **Keep functions small and focused** - Each function should do one thing well
- **Use meaningful variable names** - Avoid abbreviations unless widely understood
- **Add JSDoc comments** for public functions and complex logic
- **Handle errors gracefully** - Always catch and log errors appropriately
- **Avoid hardcoding values** - Use environment variables or configuration files
- **Validate inputs** - Use Joi schemas for API validation
- **Use async/await** - Prefer async/await over raw promises

### Example Code Style

```javascript
// Good
const calculateTotalFees = async (studentId, feeStructureId) => {
  try {
    const student = await Student.findById(studentId);
    if (!student) {
      throw new Error('Student not found');
    }
    
    const feeStructure = await FeeStructure.findById(feeStructureId);
    return feeStructure.calculateTotal(student);
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Failed to calculate fees', { studentId, error });
    throw error;
  }
};

// Bad
const calc = (sid, fid) => {
  return Student.findById(sid).then(s => {
    return FeeStructure.findById(fid).then(f => f.calculateTotal(s));
  });
};
```

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Running Tests

#### 1. Install root dependencies (first time only)

```bash
# From the project root
npm install
```

#### 2. Run the full test suite

```bash
# From the project root
npm test
```

All tests mock both the Stellar SDK and MongoDB — **no real network connection or running database is required**.

Expected output:

```
PASS tests/stellar.test.js
PASS tests/payment.test.js
PASS tests/payment-limits.test.js
...

Test Suites: X passed, X total
Tests:       X passed, X total
Time:        ~5s
```

#### 3. Run a single test file

```bash
npm test -- tests/stellar.test.js
npm test -- tests/payment.test.js
npm test -- tests/payment-limits.test.js
```

#### 4. Check code coverage

```bash
# Backend (root Jest config → backend/src)
npm run coverage

# Frontend (frontend/jest.config.js → frontend/src)
npm run coverage:frontend

# Equivalent one-off form (works for either package):
npm test -- --coverage
```

Jest will print a per-file coverage table (lines, statements, **functions and branches**) and write a full report to:

- `coverage/backend/` — backend source (`backend/src`)
- `coverage/frontend/` — frontend source (`frontend/src`)

Each directory contains `lcov-report/index.html` (browsable), `lcov.info`, `coverage-summary.json` and `cobertura-coverage.xml`. See [Test Coverage](#-test-coverage) for the measured baseline, thresholds, and the expectation for new code.

#### Test files and what they cover

| File | Coverage |
|------|----------|
| [`tests/stellar.test.js`](tests/stellar.test.js) | Stellar service: asset detection, fee validation, amount normalisation, transaction verification, ledger sync |
| [`tests/payment.test.js`](tests/payment.test.js) | Payment API: full payment flow, all endpoints, edge cases, error handling |
| [`tests/payment-limits.test.js`](tests/payment-limits.test.js) | Payment limits: validation, boundary cases, error codes |

#### Environment variables for tests

Tests use mocks and do **not** require a real `.env` file. If you want to run the backend's own test suite separately:

```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

The backend tests also use mocks; no live MongoDB or Stellar Horizon connection is needed.

### Test Coverage Requirements

- **New features** must include unit tests
- **Bug fixes** should include regression tests
- **API endpoints** require integration tests
- **Critical services** (Stellar integration, payment processing) require comprehensive test coverage

### Writing Tests

We use **Jest** as our testing framework. Tests should:

- Be isolated and not depend on external services
- Mock Stellar SDK calls to avoid hitting the network
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

**Example Test:**

```javascript
describe('Payment Validation', () => {
  it('should reject payments below minimum amount', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const payment = { amount: 0.001, studentId: 'STU001' };
    
    // Act
    const result = await validatePayment(payment);
    
    // Assert
    expect(result.valid).toBe(false);
    expect(result.error).toContain('below minimum');
  });
});
```

## 📊 Test Coverage

StellarEduPay measures test coverage on every pull request (see issue #1288). Coverage is collected with Jest's instrumentation for **`backend/src`** (root Jest config) and **`frontend/src`** (frontend Jest config). The CI `coverage` job runs both and uploads the reports as downloadable artefacts on every PR, so reviewers can inspect exactly which code paths a change exercises.

### What is measured

Coverage is reported for **four metrics** — lines, statements, functions, and **branches** — and branch coverage is tracked and reported separately from line coverage. Every defect enumerated in #1288 is an *unexecuted branch* inside a function whose other branches are tested, so branch coverage is the signal that would have surfaced them; line coverage alone would have partially masked them.

### Running it locally

| Command | Scope |
|---------|-------|
| `npm run coverage` | backend (`backend/src`) |
| `npm run coverage:frontend` | frontend (`frontend/src`) |
| `npm test -- --coverage` | whichever package you run it in |

Reports land in `coverage/backend` and `coverage/frontend` (`lcov-report/index.html`, `lcov.info`, `coverage-summary.json`, `cobertura-coverage.xml`).

### Measured baseline

The baseline below was captured from `main` and is recorded here and in issue #1288. **It is preliminary**: ~64 of 219 suites are currently failing (the blocked prerequisite in #1288), so the numbers understate real coverage. They will be re-measured and the floors raised once the suite is green.

| Area | Lines | Branches | Functions | Statements |
|------|-------|----------|-----------|------------|
| `backend/src` | 49.45% | 43.12% | 44.34% | 48.77% |
| `frontend/src` | 39.37% | 47.27% | 23% | 38.2% |

The no-regression floors configured in the Jest configs (set at the measured baseline, with a small margin for run-to-run variance) are:

| Scope | Lines | Branches | Functions | Statements |
|-------|-------|----------|-----------|------------|
| global — all of `backend/src` **except** `services/`, `middleware/`, `controllers/` | 51% | 46% | 37% | 51% |
| `backend/src/services/` | 53% | 45% | 51% | 52% |
| `backend/src/middleware/` | 52% | 45% | 42% | 50% |
| `backend/src/controllers/` | 37% | 32% | 32% | 36% |
| `frontend/src` (global) | 39% | 47% | 22% | 38% |

### Thresholds (no-regression floor)

A `coverageThreshold` is set in each Jest config at (or slightly below) the measured baseline, so coverage **cannot regress** from the numbers above:

- **Global floor** — applies repo-wide. A PR that drops overall coverage below the baseline fails the coverage check.
- **Per-directory floors** for `backend/src/services/`, `backend/src/middleware/` and `backend/src/controllers/` — the money, auth and tenant-isolation code. These carry the same starting floor today, but are the areas intended to be held to a *much higher* bar (target ≥ 70%) once the suite is green, because error-handling and failover paths there are exactly what a payments platform depends on.

> The CI `coverage` job is intentionally **non-gating** for now: with the suite red, a low baseline must not block merges. The thresholds still enforce "no further regression." When the suite is green, promote the job to a required check and raise the per-directory floors.

### Expectation for new code

- New features and bug fixes **must** ship with tests (regression tests for fixes).
- Cover the **error-handling and failover branches**, not just the happy path — that is where the highest-risk, least-tested code lives.
- A PR should not reduce coverage below the global floor, and should aim to meet or exceed the threshold for the directory it touches.
- Coverage on changed lines is the primary review signal; treat a drop there as a request to add tests.

### Follow-up backlog

The ten lowest-covered modules under `backend/src/services/` are tracked in follow-up issue **#1303** — the concrete backlog this measurement produces.

## 🏗 Architecture Guidelines

### Service-Oriented Architecture

We follow a strict **Service-Oriented Architecture**. To maintain the codebase:

#### Backend Layer Responsibilities

**Routes (`backend/src/routes/`)**
- Define endpoints only
- Apply middleware (auth, validation, rate limiting)
- Delegate to controllers

**Controllers (`backend/src/controllers/`)**
- Extract request data
- Call service methods
- Format responses
- **Do not put business logic here**

**Services (`backend/src/services/`)**
- Contains all business logic
- Handles external API calls (Stellar Horizon, webhooks)
- Manages database transactions
- All Stellar-specific logic **must** go into `stellarService.js`

**Models (`backend/src/models/`)**
- Mongoose schemas
- Database validation rules
- Instance methods for model-specific operations

**Middleware (`backend/src/middleware/`)**
- Authentication and authorization
- Request validation (Joi schemas)
- Error handling
- Rate limiting and idempotency

#### Frontend Architecture

- Use **Functional Components** with React Hooks
- Style with **Tailwind CSS** (via `globals.css`)
- UI components in `frontend/src/components/`
- Page-level logic in `frontend/src/pages/`
- All backend communication through `frontend/src/services/api.js`

### Adding New Features

When adding a new feature:

1. **Update API spec first** - Document in `docs/api-spec.md`
2. **Create service layer** - Add business logic to appropriate service
3. **Add controller** - Create controller to handle HTTP requests
4. **Define routes** - Add routes with proper middleware
5. **Add validation** - Create Joi schema in `middleware/schemas/`
6. **Write tests** - Add unit and integration tests
7. **Update docs** - Document in relevant markdown files

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

As a blockchain-based payment system, security is paramount:

### Environment Variables
- Never hardcode sensitive values (wallet addresses, secret keys, API keys)
- Refer to `.env.example` files for required configuration
- Use `process.env` to access environment variables
- Never commit `.env` files to version control

### Stellar Protocol Security
- **Memo Validation:** Always ensure `studentId` is passed correctly in the Stellar Memo field
- **Secret Keys:** Never log or store secret keys. Only use public keys for ledger lookups
- **Amount Validation:** Use `amountNormalizer.js` for safe decimal handling
- **Transaction Verification:** Always verify transactions against the blockchain

### API Security
- Use JWT authentication for protected endpoints
- Implement rate limiting on all public endpoints
- Validate all inputs with Joi schemas
- Use idempotency keys for payment operations
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks

### Data Privacy
- Never log sensitive information (passwords, secret keys, PII)
- Follow GDPR principles for data handling

---

## 🧪 Testing Standards

We maintain a high bar for reliability with comprehensive test coverage.

### Test Types

**Unit Tests**
- Test individual functions and utilities
- Mock external dependencies (Stellar SDK, database)
- Focus on edge cases and error handling

**Integration Tests**
- Test complete API flows
- Verify database operations
- Test middleware chains

**Example Test Structure:**

```javascript
describe('Fee Adjustment Engine', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup test data
  });
  
  afterEach(() => {
    // Cleanup
  });
  
  it('should apply early payment discount', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const payment = { amount: 100, dueDate: '2026-04-30' };
    
    // Act
    const adjusted = await feeAdjustmentEngine.apply(payment);
    
    // Assert
    expect(adjusted.finalAmount).toBe(95);
    expect(adjusted.discountApplied).toBe(5);
  });
});
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all backend tests
cd backend
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test -- tests/verify_fee_validation.js

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Test Requirements for PRs

- All new features must include tests
- Bug fixes should include regression tests
- Tests must pass before PR can be merged
- Aim for meaningful test coverage, not just high percentages

## 📐 Coding Standards

### JavaScript Style Guide

**General Rules:**
- Use ES6+ syntax (async/await, arrow functions, destructuring)
- 2 spaces for indentation
- Single quotes for strings
- Semicolons at end of statements
- Max line length: 100 characters

**Naming Conventions:**
- `camelCase` for variables and functions
- `PascalCase` for classes and React components
- `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants
- Prefix private methods with underscore: `_privateMethod`

**File Naming:**
- `camelCase.js` for utilities and services
- `PascalCase.jsx` for React components
- `kebab-case.js` for routes and middleware

### Code Quality

**Functions:**
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Use descriptive names that explain what the function does
- Limit parameters to 3-4; use options object for more
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

**Error Handling:**
- Always use try-catch for async operations
- Log errors with context using the logger utility
- Throw meaningful error messages
- Use custom error classes when appropriate

**Comments:**
- Write self-documenting code first
- Add comments for complex business logic
- Explain "why" not "what"
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

### Example Code Style

```javascript
/**
 * Processes a payment transaction and updates student balance
 * @param {string} studentId - The student's unique identifier
 * @param {Object} transaction - Stellar transaction object
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} Updated payment record
 */
const processPayment = async (studentId, transaction) => {
  try {
    const student = await Student.findOne({ studentId });
    if (!student) {
      throw new Error(`Student not found: ${studentId}`);
    }
    
    const amount = amountNormalizer.fromStroops(transaction.amount);
    const payment = await Payment.create({
      studentId,
      amount,
      transactionHash: transaction.hash,
      status: 'confirmed'
    });
    
    await student.updateBalance(amount);
    logger.info('Payment processed', { studentId, amount, hash: transaction.hash });
    
    return payment;
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Payment processing failed', { studentId, error });
    throw error;
  }
};
```

## 🏛 Architecture Guidelines

### Service Layer Principles

**Stellar Service (`stellarService.js`)**
- All Horizon API calls go here
- Transaction parsing and validation
- Memo extraction and decryption
- Use `stellarRateLimitedClient.js` for rate-limited calls

**Payment Service (`paymentService.js`)**
- Payment creation and verification
- Student balance updates
- Payment status management

**Transaction Service (`transactionService.js`)**
- Transaction polling and syncing
- Retry logic for failed transactions
- Idempotency handling

### Database Best Practices

- Use Mongoose models for all database operations
- Implement soft deletes (see `utils/softDelete.js`)
- Use transactions for multi-document updates
- Index frequently queried fields
- Validate data at schema level

### API Design

- Follow RESTful conventions
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Return consistent response format (see `utils/responseHelper.js`)
- Version APIs when making breaking changes
- Document all endpoints in `docs/api-spec.md`

### Error Handling

- Use centralized error handler middleware
- Return user-friendly error messages
- Log detailed error context for debugging
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes
